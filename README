This folder contains the source code for the Bamboo Sauce OnDemand plugin.

To build the plugin, you will need the <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DEVNET/Developing+your+Plugin+using+the+Atlassian+Plugin+SDK">Atlassian Plugin SDK</a>, which includes a self-contained Maven 2 instance.  

The plugin also references the Sauce Connect 2 library, which is hosted in the Sauce Labs Cloudbees Maven repository (https://repository-saucelabs.forge.cloudbees.com/release).  

It can also be built from source and can be obtained from git@github.com:saucelabs/sauce-connect.git.  Once the source has been obtained, it can be built by running 'mvn package' and installed by running:

	mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.saucelabs -DartifactId=sauce-connect -Dversion=3.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/sauce-connect.jar

To build (compile,test,jar) the plugin run:

To run a local instance of Bamboo with the plugin (and its dependencies installed), run:

	atlas-run

To run the local instance of Bamboo in debug mode, run:

	atlas-debug

To run the integration (Selenium) tests for the plugin, run:
